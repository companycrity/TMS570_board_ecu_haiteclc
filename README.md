# Electric Power Steering (EPS) System for HAITEC LC

This project implements a complete **Electric Power Steering (EPS)** system for the **HAITEC LC** platform. Here are the key features:

## Features
- **Key Components**:
  - **TMS570**: The microcontroller used for EPS control.
  - **AUTOSAR**: The software development standard for automotive embedded systems.
  - **ISO26262 ASIL D**: The functional safety standard for automotive systems.
  - **CAN**: Controller Area Network, a communication protocol for automotive systems.
  - **UDS**: On-board diagnostics protocol.
- **Functionality**:
  - Precise power-assisted steering control.
  - Electric motor power management.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Compile and flash the code onto the TMS570 microcontroller.

## HAITEC LC Platform
The **HAITEC LC** platform is an advanced electronic architecture for vehicles produced by HAITEC. Here are some examples of vehicles based on the HAITEC LC platform:

1. **HAITEC XYZ**: Description of the vehicle and its characteristics.
2. **HAITEC ABC**: Description of the vehicle and its characteristics.
3. **HAITEC 123**: Description of the vehicle and its characteristics.
